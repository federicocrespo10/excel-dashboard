2020 was a particular year for everyone. I was on a holidays in Melbourne, Australia, when te pandemic landed in the world. I got stuck there, so I got a Working Holiday Visa.

I performed all types of jobs, which was pretty cool. One of them was installing traffic barriers in the night, on Melbourne roads and highways. I created this dashboard in Excel to discover KPIS, main mistakes, how much was the time and money we were spending in unnecesary tasks or unforced errors.
